\title{
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
Generat your model experiment plan
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
This function is the last one you run. It generates a list readable by the \code{runexpplan} function to launch the parameters experimentation.
}
\usage{
addtoexperimentplan(simulation, experimentplan = list(), id = length(experimentplan))
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{simulation}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{simulation} here~~
}
  \item{experimentplan}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{experimentplan} here~~
here you paste the list generated by \code{getmodelparameter} and uploaded by \code{setparametervalue}.
}
  \item{id}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{id} here~~
as an \code{experimentplan} is a list, it can contain more than one plan. So \code{id} specify which layer of your list you want to run.
}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\value{
This function return all monitored value defined in the GUI experiment in Gama as a layer list.
