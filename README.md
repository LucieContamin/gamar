gamar is an [R](https://www.r-project.org/) interface to the [GAMA simulation platform](http://gama-platform.org/).
The version 0.1.0 of the R gamar package needs version 1.6.2 of the GAMA simulation platform to be installed on the machine.

## requirement
* R
* GAMA
* gamar

## Quick start
We assume you have got R and GAMA installed on your machine. You then need to install gamar package. The best way to proceed is using [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package.

If devtools is not yet installed

    install.packages("devtools")

Once devtools installed you can install gamar :

    library(devtools)
    install_github("choisy/gamar")
